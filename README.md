# Daniel Clements

A junior full-stack web developer who made the smooth transition from archaeology via the NHS. I am energetic, ambitious and always keen to learn more and develop my own understanding. Since coming into tech I have never balked at the opportunity to get to grips with a thorny problem and am looking forward to having plenty more opportunities!


## More about me

I have built and deployed a website [here](http://danielclements.co.uk/)(IN PROGRESS) where you can see my portfolio.  
  
I keep a semi-humorous blog of my journey into coding. This can be found [here](https://clemies2000.wixsite.com/codingwithdaniel).

(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)
