# Daniel Clements

A junior full-stack web developer who made the smooth transition from archaeology via the NHS. I am energetic, ambitious and always keen to learn more and develop my own understanding. Since coming into tech I have never balked at the opportunity to get to grips with a thorny problem and am looking forward to having plenty more opportunities!


## More about me

I have built and deployed a website [here](https://danielclements.netlify.app/)(currently a work in progress) where you can see my portfolio.  
  
I keep a semi-humorous blog of my journey into coding. This can be found [here](https://clemies2000.wixsite.com/codingwithdaniel).

## Skills

#### Presenting/Public Speaking

- Presented extensive project plans and updates for approval by stakeholders

#### Organisation and Time Keeping

One of the easiest ways to improve job performance in any industry is to be well organised and concious of all necessary deadlines and task priorities. This was one of the first things I learned that truly allowed me to develop professionally and I still hold that this is just as relevant while making this transition into a junior developer role.

- I restructured the Imaging and Diagnostics team at UCLH to correct a worrying downward trajectory
- My change to deadlines and prioritisation using an agile methodology assisted in good working relations with stakeholders
- Organised and chaired multiple meetings with a variety of internal and external stakeholders
- I run 2 weekly mystery themed games which involve planning up to a year in advance and over 100 named characters
