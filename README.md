# Daniel Clements

A junior full-stack web developer who made the smooth transition from archaeology via the NHS. I am energetic, ambitious and always keen to learn more and develop my own understanding. Since coming into tech I have never balked at the opportunity to get to grips with a thorny problem and am looking forward to having plenty more opportunities!
